        "summary": "Nicolas Saenz’s feature film debut is a side-splitting mockumentary about a pretentious film student’s existential crises (yes, plural) while making a short film. Working with Nick is always a blast and his film presented a great opportunity to focus on dialogue editing and find ways sound design can add to a genre you might not think sound design has a place in. Some of my favorite work in the film are the sound effects I created for the film’s intertitles, you can hear one of them at the beginning of my reel.",
